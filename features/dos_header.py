Here's a small example of why you gotta be carefull when bidding your lifesavings away at auctions.  While doing some research for a new purchase of mine (;)) I came
across this lot at a large auction house.  On the surface it appears to be a platinum AP Tourbillon Automatique avec Reserve de Marche ref 25718PT with a partially complete set.NoneHowever upon
closer inspection, the tag included has the reference number of a gold (25718BA) reference.  This tells me that someone assembled this set after the fact.  It is not mentioned
in the lot description as well.  Not a huge deal but a careless bidder could easily spend too much on a watch they thought had a legitimate set.
It shocks me that auction houses don't pay more attention to these  finer details.
